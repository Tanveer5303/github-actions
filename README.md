# github-actions Readme file
This repository contains my Github Action POCs which I have implemented .

Manual Steps :-

Go to the directory 
run "npm install" command to install all 3rd parties dependencies

now we can run "npm run dev" to execute the script in the package.json file which will start the development server which will host the website on your local system

npm test --> to run test from test code

That will be very good if this application is hosted on GITHUB basically on remote repository and the test runs everytime as new code is pushed to the remote repository .

Now that we will set up with help of github actions

Automating Using GitHub Actions :-

Start with initializing the git repository --> git init 
after this you will see a new .gitignore file in the folder structure
